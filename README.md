# Portfolio Website README

Hello World! This is my portfolio website. It's been due too long. It was supposed to have been completed a few years ago but i fell out of love with web developement, haha. But I am rediscovering that love again.


## Tools Used for Developement

In this development project, I used the basic fundamentals of web developement
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS blended with some custom css
- JavaScript

Tailwind was the last CSS framework I understood better before the hiatus, so being back now, it is only right I go back, hehe. This developement experience has been crazy. I can't say I miss this, I do love that I am coding web development again. I've been in the Data trenches a long time.

## Project Structure

My project is structured simply:
- at the core is ```index.html``` - the homepage
- various tabs of the page (about, contact, projects, blogs) all under seperately grouped in respective directories
